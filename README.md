# RateLimiter

Defination:
A rate limiter is a mechanism that restricts the number of requests or operations that can be performed within a certain time frame, in order to prevent excessive usage or abuse of a resource. Essentially, it sets a limit on how many times a particular action can be performed within a given period of time. This is often used in software systems to prevent overloading, protect against denial of service attacks, or enforce usage policies.

How can we Implement the ratelimiter?
  They are mainly four ways;
      1>leaky Bucket
      2>Sliding Window
      3>Variable Window
      4>Token Bucket
      
 Here is the Simple diagram in implementation of the ratelimiter
 

 
 


There are several advantages of using a rate limiter in software systems:

Protection against overloading: Rate limiting helps prevent the overloading of resources such as servers or databases by limiting the number of requests or operations that can be performed in a given period of time. This helps to ensure that the system operates within its capacity and does not become overwhelmed.

Preventing abuse: Rate limiting can be used to prevent abuse of a system or service by limiting the number of requests or operations that can be performed by a particular user or IP address. This can help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force attacks, or other types of malicious activity.

Improved performance: By preventing overloading and abuse, rate limiting can help improve the overall performance and reliability of a system. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and that users are able to access the system or service without encountering errors or delays.

Enforcing usage policies: Rate limiting can be used to enforce usage policies or limits on a system or service. For example, a rate limiter can be used to limit the number of API calls that a particular user or application is allowed to make in a given period of time, or to limit the amount of data that can be uploaded or downloaded.

Flexibility: Rate limiting can be implemented in a variety of ways, such as by limiting the number of requests per second, per minute, or per hour. This allows for flexibility in setting limits that are appropriate for the specific needs of the system or service.

Reduce the cost: If you use the cloud sevices for your application the if no of request increases then the system autoscales on its own that increaes the cost
